## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My website is to be used by players of the new game "Team Fight Tactics". This app will be used for keep track of your game stats.
The website will display all the items and champions that are in the game. You will also be able to log every game you play,
keeping track of the characters and items you used during the game. Logging your games will keep track of your overall win/loss ration.
Users will find this website useful to keep track of the team compositions that do well and display useful stats.

I got the idea because i play this game and there are websites that do these similar things but i want to combine them all into one site and improve upon them.

Search Other Users: Users will be able to search for other user profiles and look at the players stats.

Search Champions and Items by name: Users will be able to search champion and items by name.

Compile data from all users: This data will show the most used champions and items overall.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to store images into a database. I will have to improve upon my understanding of java and databases.
